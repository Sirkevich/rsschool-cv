### Briefly About Myself:
******
I like learning something interesting and new, growing and working in greate team. WEB development has many advantages such as great and helpful community, you never stop learning and growing, a lot of resources available if you ever get stuck at something. I worked with some web-technologies and also have experience of head of the Center for Information Systems with a demonstrated history of working in the military industry. I believe that it will help me and i will be a good frontend developer very soon)
